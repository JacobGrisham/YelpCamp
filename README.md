## About
First full-stack web application. Fundamentally, it's Yelp for campsites. The main features are login, sign-up, Admin role, Google Maps API, and Create, Edit, Update, Delete (CRUD) for campgrounds, comments, and reviews. Create routes have authentication. Edit, Update, and Delete routes have authentication and authorization. The basic foundation was built in the capstone project from the Udemy course [The Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/). Compared to the other projects, this one is meant to display proficiency with non-bleeding edge technologies.

## Methodology
Stack: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, Node.js, ExpressJS, MongoDB
- GoormIDE to gain exposure to cloud-based IDE
- Bootstrap 4 as the CSS framework to keep the UI simple and quick to build
- ExpressJS as the Node.js application framework for its basic functionality. Some companies still use ExpressJS so it was important to implement it.
- PassportJs for the authentication and authorization
- NoSQL database for the flexibility compared to a SQL database, MongoDB in particular because of its prevalence in the industry.
- Git for version control
- Site is hosted on Heroku
- Database is hosted on MongoDB Atlas

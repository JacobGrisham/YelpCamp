## ‚öñÔ∏è Methodology
-	Developed app in [GoormIDE](https://ide.goorm.io/) to gain exposure to cloud-based IDE.
-	[Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/) as the CSS framework to keep the UI simple and quick to build.
-	[ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/) as the Node.js application framework for its basic functionality. Some companies still use ExpressJS so it was important to implement it.
-	[PassportJs](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport) for the authentication and authorization.
-	NoSQL database for the flexibility compared to a SQL database, [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) in particular because of its prevalence in the industry.
-	[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) due to the simple nature of the application and don't foresee scaling up server usage.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features
-	Login, sign-up, Admin role
-	REST API (create, read, update, delete) for campgrounds, comments, and reviews
-	Create routes have authentication
-	Edit, Update, and Delete routes have authentication and authorization
-	[Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation)

To Do:
-	Sort campgrounds by review, distance, country, and state
-	Disallow duplicate campgrounds. I.e. no more than one unique campground
-	Not safe for work (NSFW) picture filter
-	Allow multiple photos to be uploaded
-	Write comment directly on show page
-	Write review directly on show page
-	Show 1/3, 1/2, and 2/3 of a star
-	Forgot password, change username, change password

## ‚úÖ Project Status
-	Complete

## üöÄ Getting Started
To run this project, install it locally using npm:

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

## üìê Tests
The integration tests using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) test the creation of data, the functionality of the schema, and the functionality of the validation. The tests are iterated over each of the models: campgrounds, comments, reviews, users.
To run the tests:
```
$ npm test
```

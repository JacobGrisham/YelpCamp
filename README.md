## ‚öñÔ∏è Methodology
-	Developed app in [GoormIDE](https://ide.goorm.io/) to gain exposure to cloud-based IDE.
-	[Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/) as the CSS framework to keep the UI simple and quick to build.
-	[ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/) as the Node.js application framework for its basic functionality. Some companies still use ExpressJS so it was important to implement it.
-	[PassportJs](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport) for the authentication and authorization.
-	NoSQL database for the flexibility compared to a SQL database, [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) in particular because of its prevalence in the industry.
-	[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) for the CirceCI continous integration and development support. Application is kept awake from 6:00 a.m. to 11:59 p.m. PST with [Kaffeine](https://kaffeine.herokuapp.com/)
-	[Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) for the free SSL certificate, which is needed for domain forwarding to [https://www.yelpcamp.app](https://www.yelpcamp.app). Cloudflare also offers improved security and performance over the defaults in Google Domains.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features
-	Login, sign-up, Admin role
-	REST API (create, read, update, delete) for campgrounds, comments, and reviews
-	Create routes have authentication
-	Edit, Update, and Delete routes have authentication and authorization
-	[Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation)

## üöÄ Getting Started
### To run this project on your system:
Create an .env file and add values to the following variables:
```
GEOCODER_API_KEY=
API_KEY=
DATABASEURL=
PASSPORT_SECRET=
ADMIN_CODE=
```
Make sure you have [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/) installed on your system
In a terminal window, initialize a MongoDB Database 
```
$ ./mongod
```
In a second terminal window, access the MongoDB Database with Mongoose
```
$ mongoose
```
In a third terminal window, install dependencies using npm:

```
$ npm install
```
And then run the application with
```
$ npm start
```
or for hot reloading (recommended)
```
$ nodemon app.js
```

## üìê Tests
The integration tests using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) test the creation of data, the functionality of the schema, and the functionality of the validation. The tests are iterated over each of the models: campgrounds, comments, reviews, users.
To run the tests:
```
$ npm test
```

First full-stack web application. Fundamentally, it's Yelp for campsites. Compared to the other projects, this one is meant to display proficiency with basic technologies. This project was based on the capstone project from the Udemy course [The Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/).
